What is the difference between a type declaration file and a type definition file?

In the context of TypeScript, the terms "type declaration file" and "type definition file" are often used interchangeably. Both refer to files with the .d.ts extension that provide type information for JavaScript libraries when using TypeScript. These files define the types, interfaces, and declarations necessary for TypeScript to understand and check the types of variables and functions when using external libraries written in JavaScript. There isn't a strict distinction between the two terms in the TypeScript community; they essentially mean the same thing.
