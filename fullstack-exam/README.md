## Project Description
my project was to implement a basic clone of the instagram site as we all know it.
- users should be able to upload pictures ( or in my case a image link )
- users should be able to view the pictures of their friends ( following )
- users should be able to explore all pictures posted on the platform and follow those they decide to
- admin should be able to administrate posts that have been reported by users
